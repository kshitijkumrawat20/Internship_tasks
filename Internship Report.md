# Internship Report 

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes my internship experience, focusing on the development of AI chatbot applications using various NLP techniques and tools. The internship involved creating five distinct chatbot applications (Task 1 - Task 5), each designed to address specific challenges and showcase different aspects of chatbot development, including intent recognition, question answering, multimodal interaction, sentiment analysis, and multilingual capabilities.

## 2. Background

The internship aimed to provide practical experience in the field of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in Natural Language Processing and chatbot development. It involved working with technologies like Streamlit, TensorFlow, Sentence Transformers, Langchain and Google's Gemini API. The projects were designed to progressively increase in complexity, allowing me to learn and apply new concepts throughout the internship.

## 3. Learning Objectives

The primary learning objectives of this internship were:

*   Gain practical experience in building AI chatbots.
*   Understand the different components of a chatbot architecture (NLP, intent recognition, response generation).
*   Learn to use various libraries and frameworks for chatbot development (Streamlit, TensorFlow, Sentence Transformers, Langchain, Google Gemini).
*   Develop skills in data analysis and interpretation for chatbot analytics.
*   Apply sentiment analysis and adapt chatbot responses accordingly.
*   Implement multilingual chatbot capabilities.

## 4. Activities and Tasks

The internship was structured around five main tasks:

*   **Task 1: Enhanced NLP Chatbot:** Developed a Streamlit chatbot using TensorFlow and NLTK for intent recognition and response generation. Integrated analytics to track usage metrics, response times, and user satisfaction.

*   **Task 2: Medical Q&A Chatbot:** Created a medical question-answering chatbot using Sentence Transformers and FAISS for efficient information retrieval from the MedQuAD dataset.

*   **Task 3: MultiModal AI Chatbot:** Implemented a multimodal chatbot capable of understanding both text and images using Langchain and Google's Gemini API.

*   **Task 4: AI Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis:** Built a chatbot that incorporates sentiment analysis using Transformers pipeline and adapts its responses based on the detected sentiment, leveraging Langchain and Google's Gemini API for response generation.

*   **Task 5: AI Chatbot with Multilingual Capabilities:** Developed a multilingual chatbot using Langchain and Google's Gemini API. The chatbot provides response in the same language in which the user asks the question.

## 5. Skills and Competencies

Throughout the internship, I developed and enhanced the following skills and competencies:

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and application of NLP techniques for text processing, intent recognition, and sentiment analysis.
*   **Machine Learning:** Using TensorFlow for building and training chatbot models.
*   **Information Retrieval:** Implementing efficient information retrieval using Sentence Transformers and FAISS.
*   **Framework Usage:** Proficiently using Streamlit for UI development, Langchain for chatbot construction, and Google's Gemini API for advanced features.
*   **Data Analysis:** Analyzing chatbot usage data and interpreting analytics metrics.
*   **Problem Solving:** Identifying and resolving challenges encountered during chatbot development.
*   **Programming:** Improved Python programming skills and code organization.
*   **Version Control:** Utilized Git for code management and collaboration.
*   **Communication:** Effectively communicating technical concepts and project progress.

## 6. Feedback and Evidence

*   **Task 1:** The chatbot achieved good accuracy in intent recognition. The analytics dashboard provided valuable insights into user engagement.
*   **Task 2:** Successfully implemented a question answering chatbot with high retrieval accuracy from the medical dataset.
*   **Task 3:** Successfully combined image and text understanding. The multimodal chatbot was able to answer questions related to uploaded images.
*   **Task 4:** Demonstrated the ability to adapt chatbot responses based on sentiment, creating a more personalized user experience.
*   **Task 5:** The chatbot was able to effectively respond to users in different languages.

## 7. Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                                    | Solution                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ensuring accurate intent recognition         | Improved the training dataset with more diverse examples and fine-tuned the chatbot model.                              |
| Optimizing response times in the Q&A chatbot | Utilized FAISS for efficient similarity search, significantly reducing retrieval time.                               |
| Handling complex multimodal inputs             | Implemented robust error handling and optimized image processing techniques.                                              |
| API Key validation and handling errors        | Added `_validate_api_key` method to validate the API Key and raise an error if the API key is missing or invalid.    |
| Maintaining conversational context | Employed ConversationBufferMemory to remember past interactions, but it needs enhancement for complex conversation.         |
| Handling edge cases and unexpected inputs | Added handling for when no file is uploaded.                                                       |

## 8. Outcomes and Impact
